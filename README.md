__Open Air Markets__ 
====================


Welcome. May your day be full of sunshine, fresh air and healthy products! 

General Concept
---------------

Open Air Markets provides a place where the user can find a farmers market
close to them and know whether they will be selling the product or 
products they are looking for.  

Future updates hope to include more accurate information and
product and vendor detail, recipes and intelligent links to concepts, ideas and uses for the market products the user intends to buy.

Capabilities

A filter is provided to
allow the list to be paired down to only the markets which have the
selected products such as baked goods, preserves, fruits and vegetables,
etc. If no product is selected from the filter, then all markets are listed for that area.

###Products selected

zip code area.
